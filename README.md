# ExpressJSNotepad
Deployed through Heroku, this full-stack note-taking application allows users to create, save, and delete notes on the web. 

## Description
This NotePad is a wonderful tool for a small business owner who wants to be able to write and save notes so that they can organize their thoughts and keep track of tasks they need to complete. The straightforward UI makes this app desirable to any user so that it can successfully simplify their life. Each note gets a title and room for plenty of text, and once it is saved it gets added to the sidebar list. The user can revist this application at any time to access previous notes, delete notes, or make new ones. Though this application seems simple, it is actually evidence of pretty complex milestones for an amateur web developer. After using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript languages to create the framework, the NotePad furthers its back-end scope with Express.js and Heroku for deployment.

## Installation
Open [this page](https://floating-waters-95861.herokuapp.com/) to access the application, which already has some example notes. Go ahead and delete notes you do not wish to keep. The application can also be installed to your local machine by cloning the repo and running the command "node server.js" in your terminal.
